Distil-Whisper is a distilled version of Whisper that is **6 times faster**, 49% smaller, and performs **within 1% WER** on 
out-of-distribution evaluation sets.

## 1. Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

The Distil-Whisper checkpoints will be released on October 2nd with a direct ü§ó Transformers integration. Instructions 
for running inference will be provided here:

```python
from transformers import WhisperForConditionalGeneration

...
```

## 2. Why use Distil-Whisper? ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Distil-Whisper is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Whisper on English ASR. Here are 4 reasons for making the
switch to Distil-Whisper:

1. **Faster inference:** 6 times faster inference speed, while performing to within 1% WER of Whisper on out-of-distribution audio:

</p>

2. **Robustness to noise:** demonstrated by strong WER performance at low signal-to-noise ratios:

</p>

3. **Robustness to hallucinations:** quantified by 1.3 times fewer repeated 5-gram word duplicates (5-Dup.) and 2.1% lower insertion error rate (IER) than Whisper:

</p>

4. **Designed for speculative decoding:** Distil-Whisper can be used as an assistant model to Whisper, giving 2 times faster inference speed while mathematically ensuring the same outputs as the Whisper model.

## 3. Approach ‚úçÔ∏è

To distill Whisper, we copy the entire encoder module and freeze it during training. We copy only two decoder layers, 
which are initialised from the first and last decoder layers from Whisper. All other decoder layers from Whisper
are discarded.

</p>

Distil-Whisper is trained on a *knowledge distillation* objective. Specifically, it is trained to minimise the KL divergence
between the distilled model and the Whisper model, as well as the cross-entropy loss on pseudo-labelled audio data.

We train Distil-Whisper on a total of 22k hours of pseudo-labelled audio data, spanning 10 domains with over 18k speakers:

</p>

This diverse audio dataset is paramount to ensuring robustness of Distil-Whisper to different datasets and domains. 

In addition, we use a WER filter to discard pseudo-labels where Whisper mis-transcribes or hallucinates. This greatly 
improves WER performance of the downstream distilled model.
